**System requirements**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Microsoft Windows: 64-bit operating system, Windows 7 or later

Apple macOS: OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later

3 gigabytes RAM

Display resolution minimum 1440 pixels wide and minimum 650 pixels high.

**Input data**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QuickNII supports standard web-compatible image formats, 24-bit PNG
and JPEG. Images can be loaded up to the resolution of 16 megapixels
(e.g. 4000x4000 or 5000x3000 pixels), however QuickNII does not
benefit from image resolutions exceeding the resolution of the monitor
in use. For a standard FullHD or WUXGA display (1920x1080 or 1920x1200
pixels) the useful image area is approximately 1500x1000 pixels, using
a similar resolution ensures optimal image-loading performance.

Preprocessing of images with other software tools is usually needed to
fulfill these requirements (converting to PNG or JPEG and downscaling to
screen-like size), but QuickNII allows storage of original image
dimensions as part of its series descriptor.
