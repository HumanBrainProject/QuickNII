**Frequently asked questions**

(1) I am using QuickNII to register my 2D coronal brain images with retrograde tracing. I completed all required steps through the filebuilder, but when I input my file to be registered the images does not appear, only the reference you have appears. Can you help me with this?

--> Please place the xml file in the same folder as the jpeg images, this usually solves this issue.
